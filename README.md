# 🛍️ Smart Shopping: Personalized E-Commerce with AI Agents

Welcome to **Smart Shopping**, a Gen-AI powered solution that revolutionizes how e-commerce platforms deliver product recommendations. This project uses a **Multi-Agent AI System** to deliver **hyper-personalized experiences** for online shoppers.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In today’s e-commerce landscape, generic product suggestions lead to:
- Missed sales opportunities,
- Poor user experience, and
- Low conversion rates.

To solve this, we designed a **multi-agent system** that simulates customer behavior, product intelligence, and recommendation logic — working together in real time.

---

## 🧠 Solution Highlights

- **Customer Agent**: Tracks user behavior, preferences, and history.
- **Product Agent**: Maintains product metadata and ratings.
- **Recommendation Agent**: Generates smart suggestions by analyzing behavior + product profiles.
- **SQLite DB**: Stores historical data to personalize recommendations over time.
